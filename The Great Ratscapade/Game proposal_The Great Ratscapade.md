# Introduction

“Survive the barn, snatch the goods, and dodge disaster in this rat’s great escapade\!”

The Great Ratscapade takes place in a semi futuristic farmland where you play as a determined rat whose mission is to navigate through a barn as a frantic farmer tries to bring you down. The goal is simple: Get through each level, collect the food and bring it back to your rat colony, without becoming the farmer’s next victim. As you adapt to your environment, the farmer becomes more innovative in his attempts to destroy you; planting one rat killing hazard after the next. Use your wits and the environment to hide, run and progress through the level without meeting a bloody demise.

## Setting

Rustic, dark cartoonish and melodramatic farmland environment. The game aesthetics will rely heavily on depth, making the player not only engaged in the character they play; but also their surroundings. Taking inspiration from games like “Limbo (2010),” and “Ori and the Will of the Wisps (2020)”

Genre and Platform  
2D side scroller, non-combat action/stealth. A game for PC.

Play Value and Target Audience  
If the player enjoys bloody, fast paced games in an eye-catching setting, they will have a lot of fun to gain from “The Great Ratscapade.” Despite its comical tone and (dark) cartoonish style; it is a game for adults.

Game and Mechanics description

Core Mechanics

* *Stealth and Cover* \- Move stealthily to avoid detection by the farmer and his drones.  
* *Trap Disarmament and Strategy* \- Disarm traps using timed input, requiring quick reflexes and strategy.  
* *Dash meter bar* \- Limited dash meter allows for quick escapes but needs to be used strategically  
* *Bait* \- Disarmed traps drop bait that will either fill up the dash meter, or the health bar.  
* *Food Collection and Transport* \- The primary objective is to reach food, secure it, and bring it back to the rat colony.  
* *Adaptive Difficulty* \- The farmer adapts with each level, placing new, increasingly complex traps and patrols.  
* *Environmental Awareness* \- The environment changes dynamically, adding new obstacles and pathways that require constant player adaptation.

**Key Mapping**

[BILD]

**Traps**  
Traps that can be disarmed with timed player input. A successful disarm rewards the player with health or a temporary boost (e.g, filling up the dash meter or health bar). The disarming of the traps will happen out in the open, forcing the player to be vigilant to where the farmer’s attention is in the background.

**Glue Trap**  
*Description:* A sticky trap that slows the rat significantly. To disarm, the player times input to kick a nearby dust pile or hay, covering the glue and making it safe to cross.

**Electric Cheese Plate**  
*Description:* A cheese-covered plate that delivers a jolt if the rat steps on it. To disarm, the player holds the input to nudge an insulating object over the plate.

[BILD]

**Hammer-on-a-Spring**  
*Description:* A hammer on a spring-loaded arm that slams down if the rat steps on a pressure plate. To disarm, the player times an input to carefully wedge a small stone under the arm to lock it in place.

**The Trusty Mousetrap**  
*Description:* A regular old mousetrap loaded with bait. Player must disarm the trap with a timed input, otherwise it will without a doubt slam down on the player.

A successful disarm will fill up your health \-or dash

The Farmer  
An old, tall and lanky man. With a southern accent, raspy voice and exaggerated movements. He will be positioned in the background. His movement scheme will vary from searching for the player, to aiming and reloading. The player can learn when to move and not from observing his movements.

* ***Distinctive Features**:* He has exaggerated, almost caricature-like features, such as a long, hooked nose, bushy eyebrows, and wiry limbs. His attire includes patched-up overalls, a worn straw hat with a brim casting shadow over his face, and tools hanging from his belt.


**Behavior and Movements:**

* ***Twitchy and Obsessed**:* He’s overly animated, with a slightly mad edge to him, as if his obsession with eradicating rodents has driven him a bit unhinged. He mutters to himself, curses at the "infestation," and even laughs maniacally when setting up a new trap.  
  **Varied Animations:**  
  * *Searching:* When looking for the rat, he stoops, hands on his knees, scanning the barn with a spotlight, humming or whistling menacingly.  
      
  * ***Aiming and Reloading**:* The farmer takes his time to carefully line up his shots, and each shot feels deliberate and menacing. When reloading, he grumbles and slams parts into place, giving the player a clear cue to move.  
      
  * ***Trap Adjustment**:* Occasionally, he’ll get frustrated with a trap, pulling out tools to adjust or recharge it, sometimes accidentally triggering it himself (which could provide humor and a window of escape).

The Rat (player)  
A ragged looking rodent that is about the size of a small cat. The rat’s almost human cleverness and demeanor will be amplified by it wearing scavenged and homemade armor from scraps.

***Patchwork Armor**:* The Rat wears armor crafted from bits and pieces of the farmer’s barn items, giving it a rugged, cobbled-together look. Pieces of bottle caps as shoulder guards, small leather scraps stitched as chest armor. These details make it clear the Rat has repurposed whatever it found useful to survive.

***Resilient Stance**:* The Rat stands with a hunched but sturdy stance, looking both alert and determined. This creature shows grit, underscored by scars or tattered armor, making it clear it has survived and isn’t backing down any time soon.

Levels  
The goal is to get from point A to point B, snatch the food and drag it back to point A without being killed in the process. The levels will be evolved by story progression as every finished level will trigger a cutscene. From there it will generate the same level with new hazards to counter, and a farmer who has learned that you have avoided his attempts to kill you. Relying on stealth and taking advantage of the level design is crucial, because it’s not just the traps you’ll have to watch out for. Keeping an eye on the farmer's behavior, and the windows of him being inattentive is also a huge part of succeeding.

Between each level a cutscene will play, which will provide more insight to the game. The cutscenes will not be moving animations, but rather comic styled images with dark themes (much like the cutscenes in “Max Payne”, *see Moodboard*)

The beginning:  
The player will start at point A, and in a cutscene discuss the plan to get the food with their rat colony. The player will then progress to point B, grab the food and go back to point A without being killed in the process. Dragging the food supply along will slow the player down, and sometimes it will be crucial to leave the food to get behind cover, and collect it as soon as the coast is clear. 

The way to the food is all about staying out of the farmer’s sight and disarming traps to progress, on the way back the disarmed traps will stay that way, leaving the player able to focus on bringing the food and themselves back to their peers without the farmer noticing. In the food transport segment the player won’t be able to get boosts or additional health, and a death will result in starting over at point B. After a set amount of times, the rat colony will have moved from point A to another point so the way back isn’t too tedious and the player can have a sense of progression. Each time a level is complete, new traps and dangers will turn up. 

*First Level Hiding Spots:*

* Crate   
* Barrel   
* Pillar 


   *First Level Traps and enemies:*

* Trusty Mousetrap   
* Electric Cheese Plate  
* The Farmer and his shotgun


The Middle:

Midgame, new pathways will have opened, and the player will have to navigate with the same pattern (progress, snatch, return). The farmer will be seen sleeping against the barn doors in the background. But, he will have sent out his drones to find the rodents, and the player will be forced to be even more vigilant about their surroundings.

*Level Hiding Spots:*

* Hay Bale  
* Pile of Hay  
* Pillar


  *Level Traps and enemies:*

* Hammer-on-a-Spring   
* Glue Trap Puddle  
* Killer Drones


Final level  
In this level, the rat will be able to interact with various items that, if timed right, will reflect the shots back towards the drones to shoot them down. To survive, the rat can interact with various reflective objects, when timed perfectly, sends the drones’ shots back. 

Taking down the drones is crucial, as each destroyed drone lowers the threat for a few fleeting moments, allowing the rat to inch closer to its goal.

*Level Hiding Spots:*

* Crates  
* **Pillars**  
    
  *Level shields:*  
* Beer Cap  
* Shattered Mirror Shards

**Final Showdown**

In the climactic final level, the player faces the farmer head-on inside the barn. On the brink of insanity, the farmer will stop at nothing to take the rat down, using his most destructive attacks yet. The player must use every bit of their cunning to evade him, moving quickly from cover to cover to stay out of sight.

**Winning Conditions:** Each time the player evades behind cover, the farmer’s insanity increases, steadily depleting his HP as he loses control. But the cover won’t last long—he destroys each obstacle in a fit of rage, forcing the player to choose carefully and plan their moves. If the player manages to survive until all cover is either destroyed or no longer needed, the farmer loses his mind completely, and the player claims victory.

**Losing Conditions:** The player must keep their health intact and survive the farmer’s relentless attacks. If they fail to find cover in time or take too much damage, the rat meets a brutal end, leaving the barnyard to the farmer’s triumph.

Unique Selling Points **(USP)**  
*The Great Ratscapade* is a high-stakes, dynamic cat-and-mouse gameplay without too much mechanics to think about. The player’s best strategy is to keep a steady eye on everything that happens on the screen, and enjoy the fast paced gameplay that combines strategic stealth, clever environmental interaction, and escalating tension against a relentless, unhinged farmer antagonist. 

* Single evolving level that changes with player progression.

* There will be a replayability value with *death count* and *timekeeper*. You might want to play the game again to beat your own death count or time of completion.

* **Thrilling Cat-and-Mouse Gameplay**: Engage in fast-paced stealth and strategy against a relentless farmer, who adapts to counter the player.

* **Stealth-Based Progression**: Time movements based on clear visual cues from the farmer, creating skill-based evasion that feels immersive and rewarding. You can’t win this game without stealth.

* The game’s setting offers players a unique atmosphere where rustic charm meets dark humor, all while the protagonist rat brings depth and personality with its resourceful patchwork armor and calculated moves.

* Environmental Watchfulness: Keep and eye on your surroundings is key for survival
