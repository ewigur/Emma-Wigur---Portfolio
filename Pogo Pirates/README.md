*8 week 2D Project - at Yrgo Game Creator*\
*Developed November 2024 - January 2025*
_____________________________________________________________________________________
*This project was the starting point of getting comfortable with building games, as well as working in a*\
*team. The latter wasn't hard, since every single one in the team really kept on encouraging and supporting eachother,*\
*which also made the first point not as intimidating.*\
 \
*This was the first game I had ever been working on, and I couldn't be more proud of how it turned out*

## A Selection of Contributions

**1. Camera**\
The camera system is based on fast paced action PvP games like *"Super Smash Bros"*. The camera keeps track of how many players are currently in the game, and adjusts a bounding box accordingly. The camera itself moves only on the X-axis, and zooms to get the feeling of depth. A dynamic camera was important to get the right feel of the game, and it was a good experience to keep that as my main focus.

**2. In game UI**\
Players don't have a health bar, instead the hit percentage goes up as players hit one another.\
I worked with the hit progression UI, and added:
- Color lerp and animation on numbers when numbers change
- Plank shake animation

An arrow shows up to indicate where a player is when they go outside of the camera bounds.\
My work on this was:
- Create an indicator based on the characters main color
- Implement a system that tracks if the player is outside of camera bounds that would trigger the indicator

| Hit Percent  | Indicator |
| ------------- | ------------- |
