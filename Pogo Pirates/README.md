# Brief Game Summary and Vision
Train Tale is a cozy, yet suspenseful 3D sidescroller where you play as a little gnomelike creature who lives among traveling human passengers on a train.\
 \
Our vision while building this game was to create characters that are easy to adore, as well as make an impactful impression on the player as the story unfolds.

*I had the pleasure to work with a wonderful team of fellow students in creating this stunning piece of game.\
It was challenging, but most of all it was fun - and I really hit the jackpot when I signed up to work with **Carneval**, a team of aspiring game devs!*

*Working on this project, one of my personal goals was to get more comfortable with taking a step back and make sure I could read and understand my own code. One of my teachers gave me a valuable tip that I will take with me wherever I go - bring out the old trusty pen and paper and write down the steps I needed to take to get where I wanted. Looking back I can tap myself on the shoulder and say that I reached that goal, and I learned so much more in the process.*

## A Selection of Contributions

**1. Following eyes**\
The first sinister encounter in the game are a pair of eyes following the player's movement. I coded the eyes to track the player based on their position/distance. Since the player has restricted movement on the trolley, it slows down to really capture the eerie stare of the stalking eyes.

**2. Nail Jump Sequence**\
The game relies on an interaction system to progress with the story. Most of the interactions triggers a cutscene that takes the player from A to B. The "Nail Jump" is one of them; initially I coded this to be an interaction where you press the interact button for each individual nail the player could jump on. It was a lot of tweaking, and hairpulling to get the snap points to match with the jumping animation. We finally decided on making the nail jump into a single interaction, and it resulted in a smooth transition between the two levels.

**3. Player Moving**\
A character and story driven game is nothing without smooth navigation. We went back and foth many times to figure out the best type of movement in our game. It started with a blend between a type of locked (rail like) movement and free movement, but we (thankfully) decided that free movement was the best for our game - we could create no go zones in other ways without making the player suffer from only being able to move left/right between cutscenes.

**My work with movement included:**
- Overall coding the movement system with the other programmers in the team
- Creating and implementing footstep sound - using animation events
- Implementing and tweaking walk/stop with animations
- Creating input action maps
- Collisions

**4. Sound Design**

I chose to take on the sound design. A big task that really gave me more respect for how intricate sound in games are - as well as the importance of it.


- *Apart from two SFX audio ("Dying Hand" and "Dead Eye Awakens"), all SFX are recorded by me*
- *All SFX and Ambience are mixed by me*
- *Tools: Audacity and Adobe Audition*

 In addition to dusting off old skills in recording, I worked on:
- Mixing audio based on game object material, size and surroundings
- Matching audio with animation using event-based triggers
- Creating systems to implementing audio in the game
- Spacial audio based on direction and distance
