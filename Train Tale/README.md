# Brief Game Summary and Vision
Train Tale is a cozy, yet suspenseful 3D sidescroller where you play as a little gnomelike creature who lives among traveling human passengers on a train.\
 \
Our vision while building this game was to make the characters easy to adore, as well as stir up various feelings on the spectrum as the story unfolds.

*Working on this project, one of my personal goals was to get more comfortable with taking a step back and make sure I could read and understand my own code. One of my teachers gave me a valuable tip that I will take with me wherever I go - bring out the old trusty pen and paper and write down the steps I needed to take to get where I wanted. Looking back I can tap myself on the shoulder and say that I reached that goal, and I learned so much more in the process.*

### Events

**1. Following eyes**\
The first sinister encounter in the game are a pair of eyes behind following the player's movement. I coded the eyes to track the player based on their position/distance. Since the player has restricted movement on the trolley, it slows down to really capture the eerie stare of the stalking eyes.

**1. Nail Jump Sequence**\
The game relies on an interaction system to progress with the story. Most of the interactions triggers a cutscene that takes the player from A to B. The "Nail Jump" is one of them, and initially I coded this to be an interaction where you press the interact button for each individual nail the player could jump on. It was a lot of tweaking, and hairpulling to get the snap points to match with the jumping animation. We finally decided on making the nail jump into a single interaction, and it resulted in a smooth transition between the two levels.

I had the pleasure to work with a wonderful team of fellow students in creating this stunning piece of game.\
It was challenging, but most of all it was fun - and I really hit the jackpot when I signed up to work with *Carneval*, a team of aspiring game devs!
