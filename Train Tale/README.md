During my second semester at Yrgo (Game Creator Programmer) I had the pleasure to work with a wonderful team of fellow students in creating this stunning piece of game.\

Working on this project, one of my personal goals was to get more comfortable with taking a step back and make sure I could read and understand my own code. One of my teachers gave me a valuable tip that I will take with me wherever I go - bring out the old trusty pen and paper and write down the steps I needed to take to get where I wanted. Looking back I can tap myself on the shoulder and say that I reached that goal, and I learned so much more in the process.

It was challenging, but most of all it was fun - and I really hit the jackpot when I signed up to work with this team of aspiring game devs!
